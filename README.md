# 06 Weather Dashboard
> A weather dashboard that shows the current and future weather information of a city

This was a homework assignment where we built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. We were tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Specifically, we used [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.
## Completed
* Designed the UI of the application with HTML and CSS
* Dynamically updated HTML and CSS
* Used a CSS framework called UIKit
* Used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities
* Used local storage to store persistent data such as the search history
* Used the stopPropagation event method on the search history chips to keep the delete button from triggering the chip
* Used the JavaScript library, jQuery, for simplicity

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
